Time Analysis and Brief Explanation:

The time complexity of this dynamic programming algorithm is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences. This is because we fill in an (n+1) x (m+1) matrix and each entry involves constant time operations.

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to compute the highest-scoring alignment by considering three possible moves at each step: match, delete, and insert. The scoring matrix delta is used to assign scores to these moves based on the characters being aligned. The backtracking step is then performed to reconstruct the actual alignment from the filled matrix.

In the provided example, the sequences "ATGCC" and "TACGCA" are aligned, and the alignment along with the scores is printed. The scoring matrix Array2 is used to guide the alignment process by assigning scores to different character matches and mismatches.
assignment 3
An undirected graph is a tree if and only if it is connected and contains no cycles. To determine whether an undirected graph is a tree or not, you can use the following steps:

Check Connectivity: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from any node in the graph. If all nodes are visited during the traversal, then the graph is connected.

Check for Cycles: Use the cycle detection algorithm to check if the graph contains any cycles. If there are no cycles, then the graph is acyclic.

Combine Steps 1 and 2: If the graph is connected and acyclic, then it is a tree. Otherwise, it is not.

The running time for these steps depends on the chosen graph traversal algorithm and the cycle detection algorithm.

Graph Traversal (BFS or DFS): The running time for graph traversal is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Cycle Detection: The cycle detection algorithm in the given code is based on DFS. In the worst case, the running time for DFS is O(V + E).

Therefore, the overall running time for determining whether an undirected graph is a tree or not using the described approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
