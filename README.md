Time Analysis and Brief Explanation:

The time complexity of this dynamic programming algorithm is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences. This is because we fill in an (n+1) x (m+1) matrix and each entry involves constant time operations.

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to compute the highest-scoring alignment by considering three possible moves at each step: match, delete, and insert. The scoring matrix delta is used to assign scores to these moves based on the characters being aligned. The backtracking step is then performed to reconstruct the actual alignment from the filled matrix.

In the provided example, the sequences "ATGCC" and "TACGCA" are aligned, and the alignment along with the scores is printed. The scoring matrix Array2 is used to guide the alignment process by assigning scores to different character matches and mismatches.
